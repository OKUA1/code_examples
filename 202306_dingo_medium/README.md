In order to use this code example you can either generate your own [Open Weather Map API Key](https://home.openweathermap.org/api_keys) and set it as an environment variable `OPENWEATHERMAP_API_KEY` or use the "fake api" (randomly generated values) provided in the code.

```bash
export OPENWEATHERMAP_API_KEY=your_api_key
```
